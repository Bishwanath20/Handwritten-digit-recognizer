# Handwritten-digit-recognizer
This project presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)–based handwritten digit recognition system trained on the MNIST dataset, consisting of 28×28 grayscale images of digits (0–9). The model incorporates convolutional, max-pooling, and fully connected layers with ReLU and Softmax activations to perform multi-class classification. Image normalization and reshaping were applied during preprocessing, and the model achieved approximately 98% test accuracy. The implementation was developed and executed using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras in Google Colab, with performance validated through accuracy metrics and predicted-versus-actual output visualization. This project demonstrates applied knowledge of deep learning, CNN architectures, and image classification workflows.
